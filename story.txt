Once upon a time, there was a woman. She lived in the wilderness surrounded by lions and tigers. She always felt alone, as she was the only one of her kind. One day, she decided that she wanted to explore the land to find out if she was able to find anyone that looked like her. 
However, she didn't get very far as she soon tripped and hit her head on a rock and was knocked unconscious. She woke up in the post surgery room of a hospital to a strange man looking over her, he said "Oh good you're awake, your appendix burst and we found you unconscious in the forest with a bruise on your head." She didn't know who this strange man was so she knocked him to the ground and ran away.
The police were alerted as she started running away. She got into a huge chase. Abruptly in the chase, she tripped on the ground. When she got back up, she was back in the wilderness. She realized none of that happened, and she was just dreaming after the first fall.
